          <p class="lead">Dear friends and followers of the Atlas of Living Australia. As we reach the end of 2015 it is once again time to extend the very best wishes for a safe holiday season and a happy and prosperous New Year on behalf of myself and all the Atlas staff.</p>

          <p>It has been a great year for the Atlas – and what better way to end the year than the launch of the Australian Government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda on December 7th which contained 10 years’ worth of funding for National Research Infrastructure! It is such a pleasure to see this long term commitment to supporting science and innovation in Australia.</p>

          <p>As with previous years I will take this opportunity to offer a brief summary of some of our achievements in 2015. And once again I will thank all of our colleagues, partners, collaborators and contributors who have made our achievements possible. It is you members of our community that make us what we are.</p>

          <h3 class="email">ALA Science Symposium 2016 - Put a marker in your calendar.</h3>
          <p>Make sure you save the date for the third ALA Science Symposium to be held on 11-12 May 2016. Our Western Australian colleagues have kindly offered to host our next Science Symposium at the Keiran Macnamara Conservation Science Centre, Perth (Kensington). We will be putting out a more formal call for expression of interest, registration and submission of abstracts in the near future.</p>

          <h3 class="email">Growth in 2015</h3>
          <p>All metrics around Atlas growth and usage continue to grow. We have now seen about 6.5 billion records downloaded from the Atlas to support a wide range of activities, with an impressive 3.5 billion downloaded in the last year alone. If data re-use is a performance indicator for research infrastructure, then we are doing quite well in this respect. You can watch the Atlas grow by checking the Dashboard at dashboard.ala.org.au. Likewise we have seen a 50% increase in the number of user sessions in 2015 – jumping from 1 million to just over 1.5 million.</p>

          <h3 class="email">A word about our records</h3>
          <p>The Atlas is now delivering almost 58 million occurrence records, and over 900,000 images (of 47,500 species). It is very important to remember that these are contributions from our partner and user community. If one was to take a quite conservative estimate of $3 as the cost of generating, curating, storing and delivering a record, then this represents a significant in-kind investment in the Atlas – at almost a 4-to-1 co-investment ratio. So – a special thanks to all of our data suppliers.</p>

          <h3 class="email">DigiVol</h3>
          <p>The "new-look" DigiVol (volunteer.ala.org.au) continues to set the standard for volunteer digitisation portals. Volunteers have now completed over 280,000 individual transcription tasks, and the site is being used by institutions around the world. This year saw a couple of "DigiVol firsts" with the transcription of a suite of characters from fish images and involvement in WeDigBio – a global event engaging participants digitising biological collections. Congratulations to Paul Flemons and his team at Australian Museum, and next time there is nothing worth watching on television, why not jump into DigiVol and transcribe a few records.</p>

          <h3 class="email">Citizen Science</h3>
          <p>The Atlas continues to support a variety of Citizen Science projects – and now we are making it even easier for people to get involved. Have a look at ALA Citizen Science Central (www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science) to find a project that might interest you. And don’t forget that the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA) is now up and running. Check out their website for information on joining and ways to get involved (www.citizenscience.org.au).</p>

          <h3 class="email">Going global</h3>
          <p>Last year I reported that Spain had adopted the Atlas infrastructure to support their own national biodiversity portal. Since that time we have worked with GBIF to make it easier for countries to install Atlas infrastructure to support the delivery of their GBIF style data. Now three more portals are at least in Beta stage (France, Scotland, Brazil), with more coming in 2016.</p>

          <h3 class="email">Our community</h3>
          <p>I would like to divert a bit from talking about what we have done to talking about who we are doing it with. We have a range of communities that are using the Atlas (biological collections and taxonomists, ecological science, indigenous ecological knowledge, education and outreach and others). We are now working through a series of engagement strategies with these communities to make sure that we are able to deliver the tools and services that best enable the work that they would like to do. We always want your feedback, so feel free to contact us at any time with suggestions.</p>

          <p>And, finally, I would like to particularly highlight and thank the ALA staff. The remarkable achievements of the Atlas are a direct result of the high quality and dedicated team that has been built here.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the reflections on the Atlas community in 2015.

          <p>Wishing everyone all the best for the holidays, and I look forward to working with you in the New Year.</p>
